<div class="notification is-info" data-bulma="notification" data-dismiss-interval="3000">
    <button class="delete"></button>
    I will dismiss in 3 seconds. And I was created only with HTML.
</div>

<div class="notification is-success" data-bulma="notification">
    <button class="delete"></button>
    I have to be manually dismissed.
</div>

<div class="notification is-primary" data-bulma="notification" data-dismiss-interval="6000">
    Removing the delete button still allows the notification to auto close.
</div>
